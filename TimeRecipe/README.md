## Usage

### Training TimeRecipe

Please follow the training scripts provided in [TimeRecipeResults](https://github.com/AdityaLab/TimeRecipeResults).

To train a single setup

```
python -u run.py --seed 2021 --task_name long_term_forecast --use_norm True --use_decomp True --fusion temporal --emb_type token --ff_type mlp --${Other Args}$
```

To train a batch of setup

```
bash scripts/ecl_96_m/2021.sh 
```

or a customized batch of experiments aross datasets

```
bash run_2021.sh
```

### TimeRecipe Results

All raw and processes results can be found at [TimeReciperesults](https://github.com/AdityaLab/TimeRecipeResults).

### Results Post Processing

1. `./notebook/error_rank.ipynb`: Convert the raw forecasting results over different random seeds to ranked results with averaged error and std.
2. `./notebook/read_res_m.ipynb`: Filter and combine the top 30 ranked results (`top_k=30`) from different datasets to a single csv file.
3. `./notebook/cor_ana_m.ipynb`: Perform statistic testing for the correlation analysis, using the combined csv file (Paper Table 3).
4. `./notebook/lightgbm_m.ipynb`: Perform the training-free model selection using a LightGBM model and pre-trained results (Paper Table 2).
5. `./notebook/count_surpass.ipynb`: Count the number of setups that TimeRecipe outperforms SOTA (Paper Section 4.1.1).
